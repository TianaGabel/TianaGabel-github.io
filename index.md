### Capstone and misc coursework

[Full-Stack Chess App](/sample_page)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

<p style="font-size:11px">
Designed and implemented a modular, object-oriented chess engine in Java supporting full rule enforcement, move validation, turn management, user authentication, and match history tracking. Developed extensible class hierarchies (e.g., Board, Piece, Game, User, MatchManagement) following SOLID principles. Included persistence through a custom user database and multi-constructor game models for saving/restoring match state.

[Employee Assignment CRM and Software Testing Suite](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

<p style="font-size:11px">
Created a comprehensive testing framework using JUnit and Mockito to validate functionality for a multi-component system. Developed unit, integration, and regression tests, achieved high code coverage, and applied industry QA practices such as boundary testing, input validation, test-driven development (TDD), and continuous integration workflows.

[Full-Stack Tour Planning application](http://example.com/)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:11px">
Worked in a Scrum-based environment to design and implement a full-stack web application. Contributed to requirements analysis, UML modeling, sprint planning, and iterative development. Implemented backend services and frontend features while practicing version control workflows, code reviews, and documentation standards.

[Mini Java to Assembly Compiler](http://example.com/)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:11px">
Built a working compiler including lexical analysis, parsing, AST generation, type checking, and code generation. Implemented grammar transformations, left-recursion elimination, FIRST/FOLLOW computation, and table-driven parsing. Produced a functioning compiler capable of detecting syntactic and semantic errors and translating code to an intermediate representation.

[Board Game recommendation system](http://example.com/)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:11px">
Developed a scalable recommendation system for board games using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) collaborative filtering. Implemented the solution in Scala with Apache Spark on a Hadoop cluster to efficiently process large user–game interaction datasets. Built a pipeline for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, demonstrating expertise in distributed computing, big data frameworks, and personalized recommendation algorithms.

[Employee & Volunteer Scheduler using OR-Tools](http://example.com/)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:11px">
Designed and implemented an AI-based scheduling system for volunteer labor using Google OR-Tools. Applied Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and CP-SAT solvers to optimize shift assignments while satisfying constraints such as availability, labor limits, and preferences. Delivered a working prototype that efficiently generated conflict-free schedules, demonstrating practical application of constraint programming and optimization techniques.
